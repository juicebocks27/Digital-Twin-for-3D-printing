# Digital-Twin-for-3D-printing
ML algorithm for a Digital Twin representation of models undergoing 3D printing utilising Graph Theory. A virtual representation of the STL file is created. The 3D printing process is optimised on the go to avoid trial and error methods and instantaneous feedback is obtained.
